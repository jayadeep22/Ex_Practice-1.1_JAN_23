#The range() function defaults to increment the sequence by 1, however it is possible to specify the increment value by adding a third parameter: range(2, 30, 3):

# 2= starting, 33 = ending(excluded), 3= step size
# for x in range(2, 33, 3):
#   print(x) 


# for x in range(6):
#   print(x)
# else:
#   print("Finally finished!")



# for x in range(6):
#   if x == 6: break
#   print(x)
# else:
#   print("Finally finished!")
